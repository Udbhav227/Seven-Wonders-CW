      Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which
      flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe
      Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important
      monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped
      pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above
      the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the
      structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar
      year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts
      shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering
      down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was
      not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest
      tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the
      residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian
      Mesoamerica.
