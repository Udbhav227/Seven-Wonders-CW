      Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from
      antiquity to the present day, in order to catalogue the world's most
      spectacular natural features and human-built structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this
      type, documenting the most iconic and remarkable human-made creations of
      classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic
      sightseers and as such only includes works located around the
      Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East. The number seven was
      chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty,
      and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times
      (five) plus the Sun and Moon.
